# gen-license-data

This tool generates a list of Go and NPM dependencies that Hydrui depends on. The intent is to provide a comprehensive list of all open source projects that the final Hydrui artifacts contain portions of, although it is hard to automatically accurately compile this list, so this list contains far more dependencies than actually ship in the final binary.
