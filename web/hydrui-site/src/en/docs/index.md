# Introduction

Hydrui is a web application that can connect to an existing hydrus client instance. Hydrus network lets you manage media files using a rich tagging system and gallery interface. The hydrus network is primarily optimized for locally archiving media from image boards and social media websites, but is extremely versatile and can be used to store and organize a large amount of documents of a wide variety of types. See the [hydrus network documentation](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/index.html) for more information.

The hydrus client software provides a powerful graphical user interface when ran locally. However, if you want to be able to run the hydrus client on one computer and access it from another, this can be quite cumbersome and unideal. Remote desktop solutions often provide a sub-par experience, adding latency, lowering image quality, and often suffering from poor integration (e.g. for clipboard or drag'n'drop operations). Hydrui aims to provide a very portable remote interface for hydrus network that can run anywhere where you have a reasonably modern web browser.

**New to hydrus network?** Before you can use Hydrui, you need to have an instance of hydrus network to connect to. Check out [Running hydrus network](./basic-usage/running-hydrus-network) for more information on how to do that.

If you already have the hydrus client running, trying Hydrui is a snap. Head over to [Getting started](./basic-usage/getting-started) to get started.
