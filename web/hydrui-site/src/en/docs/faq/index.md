# Frequently Asked Questions

(And questions that are not yet frequently asked, but are anticipated to be of interest...)

## How do you pronounce &ldquo;Hydrui&rdquo;?

I usually say &ldquo;hai-drew-E&rdquo;, where the &ldquo;ui&rdquo; portion is pronounced like 「うい」. It's also reasonable to pronounce the &ldquo;ui&rdquo; portion like the initialism &ldquo;U.I.&rdquo;, saying it more like "hai-drew-I&rdquo;.

It's kind of a bad name, but at the end of the day, the name had to be something.

## Who is the character on the front page?

The nondescript character on the front page is the &ldquo;mascot&rdquo; of Hydrui. The file is named &ldquo;ui-tan&rdquo;. That is basically the extent of the lore I've come up with. It was drawn and vectored by me, so you might consider it a sort-of [programmer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer_art).

It seemed appropriate to have some sort of anime-style mascot character for this software, so there it is. Maybe the design could be iterated on if a real artist steps in.

Here's a couple of sketches, for good measure.
