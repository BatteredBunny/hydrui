# Alternatives

There are other options in the hydrus network ecosystem that you may find more suitable for your needs, especially if you want something more mobile friendly. There is a list in the hydrus network documentation in the [client api page](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/client_api.html#client_browsing).

It is possible to use Hydrui alongside other clients like [Hydrus Web](https://hydrus.app). There's no particular reason you only have to stick to one client.
